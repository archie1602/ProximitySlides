# Proximity Slides Mobile Application
This mobile application is a context-aware service for collaborative presentation viewing among users who are physically nearby. This application is based on the concept of [network spatial proximity](http://injoit.org/index.php/j1/article/view/1057). For data transfer, [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) technology is used.

This application was developed as a Master's Thesis at [Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU)](https://msu.ru/en/)
